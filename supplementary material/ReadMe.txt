All folders include the source code (.R), the numerical results (.RData and .txt) and plots (.png).

Section 4: Simulations
 Simulation 1:
   The source code is contained in the folder "2019-03-22-simulation-comparison-copula-diagonal".
 Simulation 2:
   The source code is splitted into two folders: "2019-02-25-simulation-comparison-alpha_loc-no_data" and "2019-02-22-simulation-comparison-FWER-power-no_data". The setup including the random seed are the same in both source code files. Note that the parameter n is only used for the multiple testing part in the second source file.
 Simulation 3:
   The source code is contained in the folder "2019-02-26-simulation-comparison-FWER-power-normal_data".
